# PD-mul-ILP  
**ILP-based PrimerDesigner version for multiple non-homologous proteins**

## Overview
`PD-mul-ILP` designs an efficient primer set for **multiple non-homologous protein-coding sequences**.  
This version first identifies all primer pairs that may cross-hybridize between different proteins using a brute-force search, and then encodes these as forbidden-pair constraints in an ILP formulation. The ILP ensures that no two selected primers form a high-risk cross-hybridizing pair, while maximizing the overall primer efficiency.

## Input Format (Required)
Create a text file where **each line** contains a protein name and its DNA coding sequence, separated by a tab character:

```text
SHP2   ATGACATCGCGGAGATGGTTTCACCCAAATATCACTGGTGTGGAGGCAGAAAACCTACTGTTGACAAGAGGAGT...
CXAR   ATGGCGCTCCTGCTGTGCTTCGTGCTCCTGTGCGGAGTAGTGGATTTCGCCAGAAGTTTGAGTATCACTACTCC...
...

## Parameters

All parameters match the global program configuration described in the main README and are supplied as command-line arguments.

## Output

Results are written to the specified output directory.
The output includes a summary CSV containing:
- Runtime for different program stages
- Number of inter and itra- protein cross-hybridization risks
- Memory usage statistics
- Efficiency of the selected primer sets

A JSON file containing the optimal primer-selection paths for each protein is also produced.
